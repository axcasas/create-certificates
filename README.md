# Certificates Creator

This repo contains a Python code to automate the generation of certificates. 

You will find 2 folders: 
1. Data: contains a sample template certificate in .jpg format and a sample .csv file containing random names for the certificate.
2. Certificates: the output folder when you will "collect" the created certificates.

## Jupyter Notebook

In the jupyter notebook you will find a simple step-by-step on how you can use the create_certificate.py function! 

Follow the steps and thatÂ´s it! You will generate all the certificates you want!
